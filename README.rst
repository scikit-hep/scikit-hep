Project info
------------

The Scikit-HEP project (http://scikit-hep.org/) is a community-driven and community-oriented project
with the aim of providing Particle Physics at large with a Python package containing core and common tools.
The project started in Autumn 2016 and its packages are actively developed and maintained.

For what concerns the project grand structure, it should be seen as a toolset rather than a toolkit.
It is not just about providing common tools for the community.
It is also about improving on discoverability of utility packages and projects.

Getting in touch

There are various ways to
`get in touch <http://scikit-hep.org/get-in-touch.html>`_
