Submodule for helpers to deal with dependencies
===============================================
"""

# Two ideas:
#
# Strict softimport tries to load at startup (like a normal Python import)
# but hides the fact that it failed until the user tries to use it.
#
# Lazy softimport doesn't even try to load until the user tries to use it.
#
# Both have the same semantics: the user only needs to have installed the
# dependencies he or she will need. But strict puts all the load-time at
# startup while lazy puts all the load-time at first use.
#
# We should have a policy and stick to it. Strict is more typical of Python
# modules, but lazy would spare the user the 1.09 second lag on startup
# if they have ROOT on their system but don't intend to use it in this session.
#
# **Edit:** Another advantage of lazy softimport: if the user tries to use the
# module, it fails with an ImportError, then they install it and try to use
# it again in the same Python session, this will work with lazy softimport
# and not with strict softimport. For this reason, I'm changing the default
# to lazy=True and would advocate that we _only_ do lazy softimports.
