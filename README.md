## Project info

The [Scikit-HEP project](http://scikit-hep.org/) is a community-driven
and community-oriented project with the aim of providing Particle
Physics at large with an ecosystem for data analysis in Python embracing
all major topics involved in a physicist\'s work. The project started in
Autumn 2016 and its packages are actively developed and maintained.
Packages from Scikit-HEP are presently used by several major experiments.

It is not just about providing core and common tools for the community.
It is also about improving the interoperability between HEP tools and
the broad scientific ecosystem in Python, and about improving on
discoverability of utility packages and projects.

For what concerns the project grand structure, it should be seen as a
*toolset* rather than a toolkit.

**Getting in touch**

There are various ways to [get in
touch](https://scikit-hep.org/getting-in-touch.html) with project admins
and/or users and developers.
