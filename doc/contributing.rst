Contributing
============

If you already have an idea for a feature you'd like to see in *scikit-hep*,
you can start by seeing how to :ref:`contribute code <contributing_code>`.
If not, we have :ref:`plenty of ideas <ideas>` we'd love to see materialising!

BTW, check also the :ref:`affiliated packages <affiliations>` as your must-have feature could already exist there ...
