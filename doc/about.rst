About
=====

The Scikit-HEP project is a community-driven and community-oriented project with the aim of providing Particle Physics at large with a Python package containing core and common tools.

The project started in Autumn 2016 and is presently being prepared for an initial beta release.

The software package defines a set of five *pillars*, which are seen to embrace all major topics involved in a physicist's worlk.
These are:

  * Datasets: data in various sources, such as ROOT, Numpy/Pandas, databases, wrapped in a common interface.
  * Aggregations: e.g. histograms that summarize or project a dataset.
  * Modeling: data models and fitting utilities.
  * Simulation: wrappers for Monte Carlo engines and other generators of simulated data.
  * Visualization: interface to graphics engines, from ROOT and Matplotlib to maybe even d3 or plot.ly.
