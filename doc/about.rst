About
=====

The project started in Autumn 2016 with a "startup team":

  * Vanya Belyaev (ITEP, Moscow - LHCb)
  * Noel Dawe (University of Melbourne - ATLAS)
  * David Lange (Princeton University - CMS, DIANA)
  * Sasha Mazurov (University of Birmingham - LHCb)
  * Alex Pearce (CERN - LHCb)
  * Jim Pivarski (Princeton University - CMS, DIANA)
  * Eduardo Rodrigues (University of Cincinnati - DIANA, LHCb)

Experiment contact persons
--------------------------

Contact persons are being identified for "each" experiment.
It is expected that contact persons get involved with the project in 3 ways:

  * Act as a bridge between the Scikit-HEP team and the experiment.
  * Provide feedback on the expectations the experiment (analysts) have.
  * Provide feedback on Scikit-HEP directions, code functionality and alike.

The current list of contact persons is the following:

    ===================   =================================
    Experiment            Name(s)
    ===================   =================================
    Belle II              Karim Trabelsi, Nils Braun
    CMS                   Valentin Kuznetsov
    DUNE                  Dorota Stefan, Robert Sulej
    LHCb                  Matthieu Marinangeli
    Mu2e                  Brian Pollack
    ===================   =================================

Contributors
------------

Every project (sub)package is under the responsibility of a coordinator/maintainer.
The list will be provided in due time.

We look forward to contributions from the community!
