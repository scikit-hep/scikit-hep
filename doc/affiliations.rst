Affiliated packages
===================

We take the good concept of an *Affiliated package* from the `Astropy`_ project.
An affiliated package is a Python package that is not part of the scikit-hep core package but is related to,
and seen as part of, the Scikit-HEP project and community.

Affiliated packages are being identified and the community is most welcome to get in touch.
